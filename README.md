# Welcome, and Let's Learn You Some *nix For Greater Good

## Purpose
The purpose of this short document is to introduce the reader to what a *nix shell is, and how to maneuver it. We shall be concise and get you using the shell in no time.
Please don't fret and worry, the shell looks intimidating at first but within a few minutes you'll start to get the hang of it. Just remember that it's super important to remember that by using a
shell we are communicating more directly with our operating system (OS). Userland, usually maneuvered through a GUI (graphical user interface, pronounced 'goo-ee'), is comprised of programs for interacting with your
OS - think games, browsers, notification apps, a GUI file system, etc. - but by using a shell you are provided with a new suite of programs for interacting with your computer one level deeper than GUI
Userland. If you want to accomplish more, stay out of GUI Userland. It's not comfortable there.

### Terminology Thus Far
* shell - a suite of programs for interacting with your OS, and one level deeper than a GUI Userland. Repeat after me: What you can do in the GUI Userland you can do in the shell! (even browse the 'net!)
* userland - where a computer user exists
* operating system - the core programs that make a computer 'work'. Most people refer to a 'computer' as what they are interacting through, but that is not the case. This is known in geek speak as Userland. 
* programs - a set of 'things' that take input and give output - It's the way you speak to your computer (browsers, file systems, games, etc.)
* GUI - Graphical User Interface, that is, a way of interacting with a computer through programs that are more visually appealing than the shell


### What the shell is and what is a command
Before we start we need to clarify one more time what a shell is, and then tell you about commands. A shell is the way to communicate more directly with your computer. It is important to note here 
that the 'shell' is typically used only when talking about a *nix operating system - that is, a system that is either Unix itself, or mimicks the behaviour of a Unix system. For more info on Unix click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).
You may have heard of the Linux operating system - this is actually a group of projects which sought to replace the Unix OS with a 'free' version that anyone in the world can use. For more on this philosophy you can click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

So the shell - how does it work? Well, it is actually comprised of small programs that have very niche purposes. Usually these programs are refered to as 'commands', and by issuing commands to
your shell you are interacting with your operating system. That's it!

1. Your shell uses small programs known as commands which allow you to accomplish what you can in the GUI Userland
2. Each command is a small program that accomplishes only one task. Thus, it is important to learn a number of commands to be able to successfully use the shell. That's where this guide comes in!

### Ready to begin?
Hopefully by now you've at least a vague understanding of what I mean when I say 'shell', and how it differs from the typical method of interacting with a computer. Now it's time to learn some commands.
The commands we are going to learn are:

* cd
* ls
* nano
